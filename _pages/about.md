## About me
I am a Ph.D. student at the  Section on Connectivity, Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, under the supervision of [Prof. Petar Popovski](http://petarpopovski.es.aau.dk/).

My current research is focused on the semantic communication, edge computing, optimization and machine learning solutions for wireless and satellite communications. 

My ambitious aim is to develop architectures/techniques that are more interpretable, scalable and data efficient.
